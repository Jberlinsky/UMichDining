Bryan and I got the Android app to a working state last weekend during Yahoo's Hack U event. The menu functions for the current day and we have a functioning refresh button to get the data feed again in case of failure.

The next steps will be to make the process that fetches data into a service that runs so that the UI is not blocked and to enable the currently broken date picker.

Features that would be nice to have for the future:
Notifications
Facebook integration 
User preferences
